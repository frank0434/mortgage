# a personal mortgage app

I moved to the Netherlands recently and started to explore mortgage options to purchase a property. 
There are many online versions one could find from bank websites or advisory blogs. 
However, I decided to build my own version to better understand how mortgage calcuation works and test my mortgage capacity within my figure tips.
