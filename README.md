# a personal mortgage app

I moved to the Netherlands recently and started to explore mortgage options to purchase a property. 
There are many online versions one could find from bank websites or advisory blogs. 
However, I decided to build my own version to better understand how mortgage calculation works and test my mortgage capacity within my figure tips. 

# some notes  
1. The app was designed for Netherlands mortgage market.   
2. The currency is Euros, but it is just a number. So you can use whatever currency unit, it would be the same number.   
3. The mortgage type is **Annuity mortgage**. 
4. The dutch tax system allows individuals to claim tax credits back from the interest that bank milked from me. Some say the rate to claim is 37% first year and decreases every year. others say it is more than that, maybe 43% for the first year. I used 43% just to make myself happier.   
5. One still needs to pay the monthly payment first then claim the tax credits.  

# addtional information  
1. One can fix part of the mortgage to Annuity mortgage and the other part to linear mortgage.  
2. There are ways to calculate the optimal ratio. I am too lazy to include that in the app. Probably not worth the effort if you borrow a small amount and the interest rate is not ridiculous high. 

**Disclaimers**  
This app is only for personal entertainment use. Please consult a professional
mortgage adviser when one needs concrete information.There are definitely rooms
for improvement. But it will depends on how much motivation I have left after I 
got things sorted.
